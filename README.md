# rmqtests
tests for rabbitmq replication 

closest documentation I found is at http://previous.rabbitmq.com/v2_8_x/shovel.html

shovel setup:
1. Shovel hello queue from server2 to server1


RMQ expects plugins to be found in RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR folder, which is different between server1 and server2
